# Advent of Code
This repository is for Advent of Code solutions.  Each year, I will choose either a new language or an old language
I haven't used in more then 2 years as a refresher.  It may also involve me learning a new editor or toolchain if needed.


## 2023
**Language:** Go (New)

**Editor:** Neovim (New)
